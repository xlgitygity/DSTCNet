***DSTCNet: A Dual-Stream Temporal Convolutional Network with Two-Stage Training for
Rapid SSVEP-BCI Calibration Under Limited User-Specific Data***

*This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of DSTCNet, a dual-stream temporal convolutional network designed for efficient and rapid calibration decoding of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). The current version includes the core model architecture, and additional components such as training scripts, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation code will be released soon.*
